Telcam - a demon that turns a camera into a smart security detector

### General description (purpose)

The “telkam” is an original firmware that turns your Chinese IP camera into a "gadget" or "detector" - a device that detects motion in the frame and transmits photos and short video clips to the messenger Telegram on alarm or request. 
It is important to note that this is not a streamer in the "classical sense", it does not transfer video stream to a server/client in a constant mode, as in conventional IP-cameras.

Supported hardware at the moment - camera module from XM (Xiongmai) IVG-G3S:
GK7205v210(v200) + Sony IMX307, 16 MB flash, original firmware [000739AG](https://download.xm030.cn/d/MDAwMDE2NDU=).
